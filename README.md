# wgs-sars-cov2
The goal of this project is to identify and visualize variation/divergence (snippet occurence) in SARS-CoV-2 genomes as it concerns the surface glycoprotein (spike protein).

Background

Understanding variation across SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and particularly spike protein sequences has important implications for the study of virology, vacccination production, and epidemiology. By identifying, visualizing, and interpreting the COVID-19 nucleotide record data, trends in variation can be emphasized, and a phylogenetic analysis can help understand the drift SARS-CoV-2 has taken in the United States. 

Workflow

Data Preparation
1. Apply a ramdomization process in order to choose random datasets as well as allowing for iterative computing from the NCBI Virus SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide record.
2. Download all of the sequences in a convenient output file format, such as a csv, to upload into GitHub.
