The goal of this project is to identify and visualize variation/divergence (snippet occurence) in SARS-CoV-2 genomes as it concerns the surface glycoprotein (spike protein).
Background:
COVID-19 continues to spread and evolve since its initial outbreak in 2019. This virus is a +ssRNA virus whose genome contains genetic instructions for the construction of the Spike (S) protein. The S protein is a 1273 amino acid-long glycoprotein that plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The S protein is a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is responsible for receptor recognition and the cell membrane fusion process upon attack. The spike protein is composed of two subunits termed S1 and S2.  The S protein is a 1273 amino acid-long glycoprotein.  Previously published work has shown that changes in biological structure and function of species are attributable to sequence pattern divergence.  The S protein has a high mutational propensity, thus our project goal is to explore whole genome patterns of divergence amongst SARS-CoV-2 strains.  We would like to better understand functional consequences of divergence within the spike protein based on snippet assessments of the protein sequences.
We hypothesize that there are divergent patterns present within the spike protein sequences. Further assessments of these divergence patterns will be critical to our understanding of the levels of significance as pertains to divergence and overall impact to the viral structure and function.
Methods:
use of python code (ex. snippet occurrence analysis code but we will need to scale it); 
use of R package, protr package, etc.
Selection of different strain seqs (based upon the snippet occurrences) and run pyMol to determine if there is any structural change
